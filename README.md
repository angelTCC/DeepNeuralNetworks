# Modeling Energy & Agriculture Data with Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Networks

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to build a strong foundation in both **classical machine learning** and **deep learning** by training, tuning, and comparing widely used models on tabular datasets related to energy consumption and agricultural production.

The models included reflect realistic, real-world choices for tabular data:

- **Random Forest:** Robust and interpretable classical ensemble model  
- **XGBoost:** State-of-the-art gradient boosting algorithm widely used in industry  
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNN):** Feedforward networks to explore deep learning on tabular data  

Through this project, you will:

- Learn data preprocessing techniques tailored for both classical and deep models  
- Train and evaluate classical ML models and deep neural networks  
- Compare performance, training time, and practical trade-offs  
- Understand when deep learning adds value versus classical methods for tabular data  
- Build reproducible and modular code to support experimentation and deployment

## ⚙️ Project Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Cleaning and preparing the datasets  
- Handling missing values and outliers  
- Encoding categorical features (one-hot encoding, embeddings)  
- Feature scaling and normalization  
- Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets  

### 2. Classical Machine Learning Models

- **Random Forest** implementation with hyperparameter tuning  
- **XGBoost** training with early stopping and grid search  
- Baseline models such as Logistic Regression or Linear Regression where applicable  

### 3. Deep Learning Model

- Simple feedforward deep neural network designed for tabular input  
- Techniques like batch normalization, dropout, and learning rate scheduling  
- Experimentation with model architecture (depth, width, activation functions)  

### 4. Evaluation & Comparison

- Metrics: accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, MAE, depending on the prediction task  
- Analysis of training time and resource usage  
- Practical considerations: interpretability, scalability, deployment readiness
